## Youtube UGC Dataset - metadata

One file is used in this paper : **all_features.csv** contains the input properties for the videos of the Youtube UGC Dataset. We use it to add the input properties to the predicting variables during the offline part of Inputec. It is an aggregation of the metrics files proposed by the Youtube UGC Dataset team that are present in the directory (see https://media.withyoutube.com/  - "metrics" and "mos").
