'Quality improvement from MB-tree is about 2-70% depending on content.', 'Fiona Glaser', '2009-08-05T00:46:33Z'
'Attempt to optimize PPS pic_init_qp in 2-pass mode. Small compression improvement; up to ~0.5% in extreme cases.', 'Fiona Glaser', '2012-09-26T20:49:02Z'
'Allow setting a chroma format at compile time. Gives a slight speed increase and significant binary size reduction when only one chroma format is needed.', 'Janne Grunau', '2014-07-18T15:44:57Z'
'Chroma mode decision/subpel for B-frames. Improves compression ~0.4-1%. Helps more on videos with lots of chroma detail. Enabled at subme 9 (preset slower) and higher.', 'Loren Merritt', '2004-12-29T10:53:03Z'
'Make b-pyramid normal the default. Now that b-pyramid works with MB-tree and is spec compliant, there s no real reason not to make it default. Improves compression 0-5% depending on the video', 'Loren Merritt', '2006-08-16T20:13:06Z'
'Add faster mv0 special case for macroblock-tree. Improves performance on low-motion video.', 'Guillaume Poirier', '2006-11-27T21:40:21Z'
'CABAC trellis opts part 1: minor change in output. Due to different tie-break order.', 'Nikoli', '2011-04-29T10:19:22Z'
'Fix two bugs in 2-pass ratecontrol. last_qscale_for wasn't set during the 2pass init code. abr_buffer was way too small in the case of multiple threads, so accordingly increase its buffer size based on the number of threads. May significantly increase quality with many threads in 2-pass mode, especially in cases with extremely large I-frames, such as anime.', 'Alexandra Hájková', '2016-11-14T14:06:06Z'
'finish subpixel motion refinement for B-frames (up to 6% reduced size of B-frames at subq <= 3)', 'Anton Mitrofanov', '2013-05-22T18:43:59Z'
'New "superfast" preset, much faster intra analysis. Especially at the fastest settings, intra analysis was taking up the majority of MB analysis time. This patch takes a ton more shortcuts at the fastest encoding settings, decreasing compression 0.5-5% but improving speed greatly. Also rearrange the fastest presets a bit: now we have ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster. superfast is the old veryfast (but much faster due to this patch). veryfast is between the old veryfast and faster. faster is the same as before except with MB-tree on. Encoding with subme >= 5 should be unaffected by this patch.', 'Loren Merritt', '2005-10-08T06:49:29Z'
'Macroblock tree overhaul/optimization. Move the second core part of macroblock tree into an assembly function; SIMD-optimize roughly half of it (for x86). Roughly ~25-65% faster mbtree, depending on content.', 'Martin Storsjö', '2015-10-15T08:50:33Z'
'Much more accurate B-skip detection at 2 < subme < 7. Use the same method that x264 uses for P-skip detection. This significantly improves quality (1-6%), but at a significant speed cost as well (5-20%)', 'Måns Rullgård', '2005-05-30T19:47:02Z'
