Chroma mode decision/subpel for B-frames
Improves compression ~0.4-1%. Helps more on videos with lots of chroma detail.
Enabled at subme 9 (preset slower) and higher.
Full sub8x8 RD mode decision
Small speed penalty with p4x4 enabled, but significant quality gain at subme >= 6
As before, gain is proportional to the amount of p4x4 actually useful in a given input at the given bitrate.
Fix intra refresh with subme < 6
Also improve the quality of intra masking.
MBAFF: Disable adaptive MBAFF when subme 0 is used
Further reduce code size in bime
~7-8 kilobytes saved, ~0.6% faster subme 9.
New "superfast" preset, much faster intra analysis

Especially at the fastest settings, intra analysis was taking up the majority of MB analysis time.
This patch takes a ton more shortcuts at the fastest encoding settings, decreasing compression 0.5-5% but improving speed greatly.
Also rearrange the fastest presets a bit: now we have ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster.
superfast is the old veryfast (but much faster due to this patch).
veryfast is between the old veryfast and faster.
faster is the same as before except with MB-tree on.

Encoding with subme >= 5 should be unaffected by this patch.
Avoid a redundant qpel check in lookahead with subme <= 1.
Much faster CAVLC residual coding
Use a VLC table for common levelcodes instead of constructing them on-the-spot
Branchless version of i_trailing calculation (2x faster on Nehalem)
Completely remove array_non_zero_count and instead use the count calculated in level/run coding.  Note: this slightly changes output with subme > 7 due to different nonzero counts being stored during qpel RD.
MMX code for predictor rounding/clipping
Faster predictor checking at subme < 3.
Faster mv predictor checking at subme < 3
Simplify the predicted MV cost check.
Fix trellis 2 + subme >= 8
Trellis didn't return a boolean value as it was supposed to.
Regression in r2143-5.
More lookahead optimizations
Under subme 1, don't do any qpel search at all and round temporal MVs accordingly.
Drop internal subme with subme 1 to do fullpel predictor checks only.
Other minor optimizations.
r1548 broke subme < 3 + p8x8/b8x8
Caused significantly worse compression.  Preset-wise, only affected veryfast.
Fixed by not modifying mvc in-place.
Rework subme system, add RD refinement in B-frames
The new system is as follows: subme6 is RD in I/P frames, subme7 is RD in all frames, subme8 is RD refinement in I/P frames, and subme9 is RD refinement in all frames.
subme6 == old subme6, subme7 == old subme6+brdo, subme8 == old subme7+brdo, subme9 == no equivalent
--b-rdo has, accordingly, been removed.  --bime has also been removed, and instead enabled automatically at subme >= 5.
RD refinement in B-frames (subme9) includes both qpel-RD and an RD version of bime.
Psychovisually optimized rate-distortion optimization and trellis
The latter, psy-trellis, is disabled by default and is reserved as experimental; your mileage may vary.
Default subme is raised to 6 so that psy RD is on by default.
Much more accurate B-skip detection at 2 < subme < 7
Use the same method that x264 uses for P-skip detection.
This significantly improves quality (1-6%), but at a significant speed cost as well (5-20%).
It also may have a very positive visual effect in cases where the inaccurate skip detection resulted in slightly-off vectors in B-frames.
This could cause slight blurring or non-smooth motion in low-complexity frames at high quantizers.
Not all instances of this problem are solved: the only universal solution is non-locally-optimal mode decision, which x264 does not currently have.

subme >= 7 or <= 2 are unaffected.
Fix subpel iteration counts with B-frame analysis and subme 6/8
Since subme 6 means "like subme 5, except RD on P-frames", B-frame analysis
shouldn't use the RD subpel counts at subme 6.  Similarly with subme 8.
Slightly faster (and very marginally worse) compression at subme 6 and 8.
Deblock-aware RD
Small quality gain (~0.5%) at lower bitrates, potentially larger with QPRD.
May help more with psy, maybe not.
Enabled at subme >= 9.  Small speed cost (a few %).
Don't force fast-intra for subme < 3

It have caused significant quality hit without any meaningful (if any) speed up.
