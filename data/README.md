## Data

For each software system, there is a directory with the name of the system containing its measurements.

Each file in this directory is related to an input fed to this system e.g. `Animation_360P-3e40.csv` is related to the input video `Animation_360P-3e40.mkv` fed to x264.

In this file, there is a dataset of configuration with their measurement (see the files for more details, or the table 1 for the performance measured).

All the other experiments for the software systems mysoft are in the `mysoft/others` directory e.g. the analysis of commits for x264 is in `./x264/others/commits_x264`.

If you want to download one of the dataset of measurement individually, you can follow the zenodo links in table 1.
